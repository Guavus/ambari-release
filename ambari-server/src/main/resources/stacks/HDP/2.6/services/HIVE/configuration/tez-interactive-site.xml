  Note: This file includes only those configs which are supposed to have different value from the parent tez/tez-site.
        It inherits the other required configs from tez/tez-site.
        The inheritance logic in order to get tez_hive2/tez-site goes like this :

        1. We read the tez/tez-site which includes the stack defaults and Stack Advisor recommended values.
        2. We take the read tez/tez-site (step 1), and on top of it apply the tez-interactive-site to get tez_hive2/tez-site.

        Therefore, any config defined here will override the config value read from tez/tez-site (step 1).
